This project  demonstrates the client server aplication

Overview:

CLient Application : Client application takes IP address of server to connect 
		     as command line argument.On, successful connection estab-
                     lishment client starts reading a text file and sends it 
		     to server in 1KB chunks.Client writes the received data 
		     in output file. When whole file is converted to capital
		     letters,client exits gracefully by closing the connection

Server Application : Server application takes port address to listen on as 
		     command line arguments.On receiving each chunk from client,
		     server converts the text into all capital letter and sends it
                     back to client.

Step to run the Client-Server Application :

-Run the Command "make" in terminal compiling source file
-If want to clear all object files type make clean

-At Client side run the following command:
     ./client <server_ip> <server_port> <input_filename>
-At Server side run the following command:
     ./server <server_port>
